# Barcoders

Barcoders is a barcode-encoding library for the Rust programming language.

The goal of this project is to support all major symbologies (EAN-13/8, UPC-A, Code128, Code25, etc) and provide several output formats (SVG, PDF, PNG, etc).

**Barcoders is under active development. Initial release expected late November, 2015**
